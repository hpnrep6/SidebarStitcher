Stitches images while also adding a bar on the right, with the option to make the bar fade into the main image.

## Saving settings

A `WatermarkStitcher.config` file is automatically created and updated each time the stitcher is run successfully. This config file saves the selected files and settings used when `Stitch!` was pressed so that it can be used again in the future.

Clicking `Clear saved settings` will delete this file.
